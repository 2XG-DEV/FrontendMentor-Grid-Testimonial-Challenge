### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was one of the first projects where I took a mobile first aproach , 
started with the most simplistic design , 
declared the global styles and used min-width media queries to add complexity for larger screens.

Also one of the first projects where I used fluid typography using clamp() for the font size
